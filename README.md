# algae-rhythm
The ultimate auto-encouraged self-helping to-do app for the ADHD mind.

Algae Rhythm is a To-Do app which aims to have a combination of utter flexibility and total customizeability with a baked-in set of to-do methodologies or styles (built via modules) which match any number of given personality archetypes.

In other words, you can make AR your own or you can use one of the many pre-built to-do styles available. All of it is built via modules which have customizeable features, like:
- Time to Live
- Recurrence rate
- Reminders
- Encouraging ( or encouragingly insulting ) words of your own choosing alerted at the time and/or frequency of your choosing
- Sortability/by what criteria it is sorted
- Difficulty of task/s
- Importance of task/s
- Longevity tasks ( filter replacement, last time changed pee pads, etc )
- Task progress tracking
- Constantly moving timeline to pin things to
